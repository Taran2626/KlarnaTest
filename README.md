# KlarnaTest App

I created KlarnaTest Swift iOS Application by using following things - 

1. Usage of OpenWeatherMap API to fetch current weather and forecasted weather using latitude and longitude
2. Another screen to search for user typed location to fetch weather
3. Implemented MKLocalSearchCompleter for autocomplete of places in searchBar
3. async/await to make network requests to our OpenWeatherMap API
4. AsyncImage to load icons asynchronously
5. MVVM architecture
6. SwiftUI
7. Units testing using mock server
